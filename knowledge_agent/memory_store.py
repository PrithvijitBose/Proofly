"""Persistent repository memory (#6).

Knowledge investigates a repository from zero on every single @Knowledge
comment, even when the same topic was already investigated minutes ago in
the same thread. Issue #6 asks for exactly the example it gives: "We
already investigated authentication. Now explain authorization in
relation to it" should be able to build on the earlier finding instead of
starting over.

This is a lightweight, file-backed memory -- JSON on disk, no database.
It never replaces fresh evidence retrieval: ContextRetriever still runs
its normal investigation on every single call, unconditionally. A memory
hit is surfaced as labeled prior context the model is told to verify
against what it just found, never as an established fact it's allowed to
skip re-checking. That is what "avoid storing unsupported assumptions as
facts" (the issue's own acceptance criterion) means in practice here:
memory augments an investigation, it never substitutes for one.

Persistence across GitHub Actions runs (the runner's filesystem is thrown
away after every job) is the caller's problem, not this module's -- see
the actions/cache step added to knowledge.yml. Locally, or under a
webhook server with a persistent disk, the file just accumulates on its
own.
